# Ngkolmpu Paralex Verbal Lexicon

## About
This is a collection of inflected forms of verbs in Ngkolmpu, a Yam languge spoken in the Indonesian Province of Papua Selatan in the southern New Guinea region.

The paradigms are currently presented in phonemic notation and closely follow the analysis presented in Carroll (2016).

The data is encoded in `csv` files, and the metadata follows [frictionless](https://frictionlessdata.io/) standards. The dataset conforms to the [Paralex standard](https://www.paralex-standard.org)

## How this lexicon was prepared
All the data here was collected in consultation with Ngkolmpu speakers in the village of Yanggandur, Merauke Regency, South Papua Provice, Indonesia. 

## The data
There are currentl 194 verb lexemes in the collection. This does not include derived or alternations for voice/diathesis. 

The current list contains a highly phonemicised version which doesn't represent phnologically conditioned allomorphy.

This is a work in progress.
